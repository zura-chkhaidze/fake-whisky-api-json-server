                    Whiskey (or whisky) is a generalized term for distilled spirits made from fermented grain that is
                    typically aged in wooden containers. Don’t let the spelling confuse you whiskey is whisky is
                    whiskey. The word is an anglicized version of the classical Gaelic term uisce (or the usige),
                    meaning water. The ultimate origin derives from the Latin term aqua vitea (“water of life”) which
                    was translated into old Irish as uisce beatha and uisge beatha in Scottish Gaelic. The spelling
                    difference, in both English and the original terminology, is a matter of regional language
                    differences. Countries like Ireland and the United States favor the spelling with an “e,” while
                    Scotland, Canada and Japan omit it.

                <div class="label">How is Whiskey Made?</div>
                <div class="content">
                    Some parts of whiskey production depend on the style being made and the country of origin, but the
                    general process is fairly consistent.

                    All types, whether they are whiskey, whisky, bourbon or Scotch, start as a raw grain. Before the
                    grain can be fermented, all the sugars must be extracted. This is done through mashing. The
                    distiller will take the grains and put them in a large tank with hot water. The mixture is agitated,
                    resulting in a porridge consistency known as mash or wort. Once as much sugar as possible has been
                    removed, it is ready for the fermentation stage. Fermentation occurs when yeast is added to the
                    mash/wort which converts any remaining sugars to alcohol. The process takes place in large vats
                    spanning from 48 to 96 hours. It is then transferred to a copper still that is used for
                    distillation. The most common types of stills used are pot stills and column stills, which are used
                    in different circumstances. Pot distillation is a batch process that is most commonly used with malt
                    whisky. Column stills are typically used to produce bourbon, rye and other American whiskeys, they
                    work continuously in order to remove the need for a batch process.

                <div class="label">How to Drink Whiskey</div>
                <div class="content">
                    The beautiful thing about whiskey is that it can be enjoyed in so many different forms. From
                    drinking it neat or straight to mixing a classic whiskey cocktail or stirring it into an inventive
                    drink – there are a plethora of ways to indulge. Sipping a whiskey neat is recommended for those who
                    enjoy the taste. It is served in a glass, directly from the bottle with nothing extra added. When it
                    is served straight, this means the whiskey has been diluted slightly by water or ice. It is not
                    served with anything, but it is chilled and then strained and served. If you order it on the rocks,
                    you’ll receive a glass of whiskey with ice. The ice slowly releases water into the whiskey which
                    allows you to detect more aromatics on the nose and taste more flavors on the palate. It is
                    recommended when enjoying a whiskey on the rocks to use one large ice cube or ice ball rather than
                    smaller chunks. Larger ice will melt slower, diluting your whiskey less quickly.
